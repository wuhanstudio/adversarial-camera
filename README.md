The Man-in-the-Middle Attack consists of two steps:

- Step 1: [Generating the perturbation](detection/README.md).
- Step 2: [Deploying the perturbation](hardware/README.md).



### Quick Start

Weâ€™ve released pre-built images for Raspberry Pi 4 that can be flashed to microSD cards:

- For development: **raspbian_minm_attack.img**
- For release: **buildroot_minm_attack.img**

Checkout the [latest release](https://github.com/wuhanstudio/adversarial-camera/releases).
